If you're in Puerto Rico for the weekend of October the 14th, be sure to check out [Startup Weekend Puerto Rico](http://puertorico.startupweekend.org/ "Startup Weekend Puerto Rico"). You'll have just 54 hours to build a business by teaming up with entrepreneurial people from various backgrounds.

Startup Weekend is being organized by my friends [Giovanni Collazo](http://www.twitter.com/gcollazo "@gcollazo"), [Jos√© Padilla](http://www.twitter.com/jpadilla_ "@jpadilla_"), [Ramphis Castro](http://www.twitter.com/jramphis "@jramphis"), and [Marcos Polanco](http://www.twitter.com/marcospolanco "@MarcosPolanco"). This core team is heavily involved in pushing Puerto Rico hard towards entrepreneurship. And what better place to exercise your product marketing, design and development muscle than [Seriously Creative](http://www.seriouslycreative.com/ "Seriously Creative"), an amazing space built specifically for nurturing ideas and helping teams rally into action.

[Tickets for Startup Weekend](http://puertorico.startupweekend.org/tickets/ "Startup Weekend tickets") are only $75 through today. You may also sponsor one lucky entrepreneur for $100. Sponsors can feed these hungry entrepreneurs for $500, or go big for $950. Enough talking, who can actually execute? We'll see come October 14.
