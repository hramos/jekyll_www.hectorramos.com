I'm Héctor Ramos, an iOS developer for [Polsense](http://polsense.com), an up and coming startup in sunny Puerto Rico. I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from [UPR Mayagüez](http://www.uprm.edu) in 2006. Worked at EVERTEC as a system architect and senior programmer for the Internet department which served [BPPR](http://www.bppr.com), Puerto Rico's largest bank.

Work didn't keep me from tinkering with various technologies, which got me into freelance iPhone development. Shortly before hitting my fourth anniversary at EVERTEC, I quit in order to pursue iOS app development and startups full time, joining Polsense.
